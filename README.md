Uses the Arduino Nano 33 BLE REV2 and the RP2040CONNECT Boards to find the angle between them

The C code (meant to run in Arduino IDE) should be uploaded to both boards one by one, then the python script should be run with them plugged in. 
Make sure Arduino IDE is closed when running in python
:)
